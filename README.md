# Final Project: Electric Vehicle Market Analysis in Washington State

## Overview

This project explores the landscape of electric vehicles (EVs) in Washington State, with the goal of providing actionable insights for car dealerships and electric utility companies. By analyzing publicly available data on EV registrations, specifications, and geographic distribution, we aim to uncover trends that can inform inventory decisions, infrastructure planning, and marketing strategies.

Electric vehicles are rapidly transforming the automotive industry, and understanding their adoption patterns is critical for stakeholders. This analysis dives into key metrics such as electric range, manufacturer dominance, pricing, and geographic concentration to paint a comprehensive picture of the EV market.
